# Electron Pet

Remembered a childhood memory with these "virtual babies" (Tamagotchi clones were called that back in the day in Turkey), wanted to check if I can "vibe code" the whole thing in a few hours on a Sunday afternoon. Tested it on Macos and only designed for that actually, if it brings a bit joy to you, this project is a success.

## How to run

```
npm install
npm run start
```

or if you want to develop

```
npm run dev
```

## How to build

```
npm run build
```

then go to the dist directory and run the app.

## TODO

Add a basic local language model support so that the pet can talk to you, remind you of your tasks, etc.
